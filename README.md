## Why Lodash?

Lodash makes JavaScript easier by taking the hassle out of working with arrays,<br>
numbers, objects, strings, etc. Lodash’s modular methods are great for:

 * Iterating arrays, objects, & strings
 * Manipulating & testing values
 * Creating composite functions

## Module Formats

Lodash is available in a [variety of builds](https://lodash.com/custom-builds) & module formats.

 * [lodash](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash) & [per method packages](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:lodash-modularized)
 * [lodash-es](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash-es), [babel-plugin-lodash](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-lodash), & [lodash-webpack-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash-webpack-plugin)
