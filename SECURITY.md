## Responsible disclosure security policy

A responsible disclosure policy helps protect users of the project from publicly
disclosed security vulnerabilities without a fix by employing a process where
vulnerabilities are first triaged in a private manner, and only publicly disclosed
after a reasonable time period that allows patching the vulnerability and provides
an upgrade path for users.

We kindly ask you to refrain from malicious acts that put our users, the project,
or any of the projectâ€™s team members at risk.

## Reporting a security issue

We consider the security of Lodash a top priority. But no matter how much effort
we put into security, there can still be vulnerabilities present.

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report the security issue
directly to the Lodash maintainers through the [Security tab](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/security) of the Lodash
repository.

Your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings are sincerely appreciated.
