> As announced on the [OpenJS Foundation blog](https://openjsf.org/blog/sta-supports-lodash), Lodash has received support from the Sovereign Tech Agency and will transition to the Feature-Complete maturity stage so that it remains stable, secure, and sustainable long-term. As part of this effort, Lodash is rebooting its governance. A draft charter will be published shortly. The upcoming Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is already at work.
